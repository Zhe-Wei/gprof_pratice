        Dhrystone Version 2.1 and 1.1 benchmark 

        It will be best to first create a directory (e.g., 'dhrystone') to
        hold all the files.


1.      UNPACKING dhry.shar

        Do the following to unpack dhry.shar:

        sh dhry.shar

        This creates all the dhrystone files as listed in the 
        'MANIFEST' file.


2.      CHANGING COMPILER OPTIONS

        To change compiler options edit 'Makefile'.
        
        The compiler default options are:     '-DUNIX -O'.
        You can change this, for example, to: '-DUNIX'-DROPT -O',
        where '-DROPT' specifies the 'Register' OPTion. Various compilers
        also come with, generally, numerous other options that you are
        free to select of course. See 'dhry.tbl' for example.
        
        '-DUNIX' is in the 'DEFINES =' row of 'Makefile'.
        '-O' is in the 'FLAGS =' row of 'Makefile'. 
        
        The '-DUNIX' option is one of several timer options avaliable.
        
        The timer option MUST be specified for the program to compile.
        
        The various timer options available are covered in 'timers_b.c'
        which you may need to examine to find the right match for your 
        machine. Here are the current timer choices:

        '-DAmiga'       for Amiga systems.
        '-DUNIX'        for UNIX systems (preferred)
        '-DUNIX_Old'    for UNIX systems (avoid if possible)
        '-DVMS'         for VMS systems 
        '-DBORLAND_C'   for PC's with Borland C
        '-DMSC'         for PC's with Microsoft C
        '-DMAC'         for Macintosh systems with Think C
        '-DIPSC'        for i860 IPSC systems
        '-DFORTRAN_SEC' for Cray systems (preferred)
        '-DGTODay'      for UNIX systems
        '-DCTimer'      for Cray systems (avoid if possible)
        '-DUXPM'        for Fujitsu UXP/M systems.
	'-DMAC_TMgr'    for Macintosh (preferred)
	'-DPARIX'       for PARIX
        '-DPOSIX'       for POSIX :)
	'-DWIN32'       for WINDOWS NT 

3.      COMPILING WITH MAKE

        Do the following to compile with make:

        make dhry21
        make dhry11

        This creates the executable files: dhry21 and dhry11. Run
        both programs and submit results. Please see 'dhryrun.doc' file.
        'dhry21' is the Dhrystone V2.1 program, and 'dhry11' is the
        Dhrystone V1.1 program.


4.      COMPILING OTHERWISE

        Do the following to compile without 'make' if necessary:
        [using the default compiler options which you can change
        of course to suite your machine]

        cc -DUNIX -O -o dhry21 dhry_1.c dhry_2.c timers_b.c 
        
        This creates the executable program 'dhry21' which is the
        Dhrystone V2.1 program.

        cc -DUNIX -O -o dhry11 dhry11.c timers_b.c

        This creates the executable program 'dhry11' which is the
        Dhrystone V1.1 program.

        Run both dhry21 and dhry11 and submit results. See 'dhryrun.doc'
        file.



5.      RUNNING THE PROGRAM

        Do the following to run the programs:

        dhry11
        dhry21


6.      REPORTING RESULTS

        Edit the ascii file 'dhryrun.doc' and please add in the

        Email 'dhryrun.doc' to aburto@nosc.mil and I will include
        in, and maintain, table of results. I will also post results
        periodically to 'comp.benchmarks'.  Results and other programs 
        are available via anonymous ftp to 'ftp.nosc.mil' in
        directory 'pub/aburto'. The IP address is: 128.49.192.51

        Thank you very much ...
